# CAD-Viewer

[简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

cad-viewer is `the first web-based DXF/DWG viewer and editor in the world that operates entirely in browser, without relying on any backend services`.
By performing DWG/DXF parsing, geometry processing, and rendering directly in the browser, cad-viewer enables true serverless CAD viewing and editing, ideal for cloud apps, offline usage, and privacy-sensitive workflows.

It also offers something you will rarely find in other CAD viewers—**one-click export to a single, self-contained HTML file**. The downloaded `.html` embeds the drawing snapshot and a lightweight viewer runtime, so recipients can open, pan, zoom, toggle layers, and measure distances in any modern browser with **no CAD app, no server, and no install**. Most desktop and web CAD viewers only let you view inside their own product; cad-viewer turns a live drawing into a portable, offline artifact you can email, archive, or drop on a static file host—ideal for sharing with clients, compliance archives, and air-gapped workflows.

## Features

- **High-performance** viewing of large DWG/DXF files with smooth 60+ FPS rendering
- **No backend required** - Files are parsed and processed entirely in the browser
- **Enhanced data security** - Files never leave your device, ensuring complete privacy

## Performance

CAD-Viewer is engineered for **exceptional performance** and can handle very large DXF/DWG files while maintaining high frame rates. It employs multiple advanced rendering technologies to optimize performance:

- **Custom Shader Materials**: Uses GPU-accelerated shader materials to render complex line types and hatch fill patterns efficiently
- **Geometry Batching**: Merges points, lines, and areas with the same material to dramatically reduce draw calls
- **Instanced Rendering**: Optimizes rendering of repeated geometries through instancing techniques
- **Buffer Geometry Optimization**: Efficient memory management and geometry merging for reduced GPU overhead
- **Material Caching**: Reuses materials across similar entities to minimize state changes
- **WebGL Optimization**: Leverages modern WebGL features for hardware-accelerated rendering

These optimizations enable CAD-Viewer to smoothly render complex CAD drawings with thousands of entities while maintaining responsive user interactions.

## Known Issues

CAD-Viewer has some known limitations that users should be aware of:

- **Unsupported Entities**: 
  - **Tables** (DWG files only): Table entities are not currently supported in DWG files because [LibreDWG](https://github.com/LibreDWG/libredwg) is used to read DWG files and it doesn't support table entity yet. If one table is created by line and polyline entities, definitely it is supported.
  - **XRefs**: External references (XRefs) are not supported and will not be displayed.
- **DWG File Compatibility**: 
  - Some DWG drawings may fail to open due to bugs in the underlying [LibreDWG](https://github.com/LibreDWG/libredwg) library. This is a known limitation of the current DWG parsing implementation. If you find those issues, please log one issue on [CAD-Viewer issues page](https://github.com/mlightcad/cad-viewer/issues) or [LibreDWG issues page](https://github.com/LibreDWG/libredwg/issues).
  - In the Chinese architecture and construction industry, CAD drawings are widely created using Tianzheng software. However, many entities in Tianzheng drawings are proprietary custom objects, and no public APIs are provided to access or parse their internal data. As a result, before opening such drawings with CAD-Viewer, they must first be converted to T3 format using Tianzheng. After conversion, the drawings can be correctly opened and viewed in CAD-Viewer.

These issues are being tracked and will be addressed in future releases.

## Roadmap

The goal of this project is to create a full-featured **2D AutoCAD-like system in the browser** (viewer + editor), with modular architecture and framework-agnostic integration.
